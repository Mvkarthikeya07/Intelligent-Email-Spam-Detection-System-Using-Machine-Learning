📧 Text Classification for Email Spam Detection Using Supervised Machine Learning Techniques

A Machine Learning–Based Text Classification Application

📌 Overview

The Email Spam Detection System is a machine learning–powered application designed to classify emails as spam or legitimate (ham) based on their textual content. The system applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a trained classification model to detect unwanted or malicious emails accurately.

This project demonstrates a complete ML pipeline, including data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, serialization, and real-time prediction.

🎯 Objectives

Build a binary text classification model for spam detection

Apply NLP techniques for text preprocessing and feature extraction

Train and evaluate a machine learning model on labeled email data

Persist the trained model for efficient reuse

Demonstrate applied machine learning for real-world text classification tasks

🚀 Key Features

✔ Machine learning–based spam detection
✔ Text preprocessing and feature extraction
✔ Real-time email classification
✔ Reusable trained model pipeline
✔ Clean and modular code structure
✔ Lightweight and efficient inference

🧠 Machine Learning & NLP Approach

The project follows a supervised learning text classification pipeline.

Methodology

Dataset

Labeled email datasets (spam.csv, emails.csv)

Text Preprocessing

Lowercasing and text normalization

Removal of stopwords and punctuation

Tokenization and vectorization

Feature Extraction

Text converted into numerical features using vectorization techniques

Combined preprocessing and modeling into a single pipeline

Model Training

Classification model trained to distinguish spam from non-spam emails

Model performance validated during training

Model Persistence

Trained pipeline saved using joblib for reuse

Prediction

New email content is passed through the trained pipeline

Output classified as Spam or Not Spam

This approach ensures consistency, accuracy, and reproducibility.
